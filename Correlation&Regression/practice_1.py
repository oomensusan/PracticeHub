# Given the test scores of 10 students in Physics and History, compute Karl Pearson’s coefficient of correlation between these scores. Round the result to three decimal places.

# Physics Scores  15  12  8   8   7   7   7   6   5   3
# History Scores  10  25  17  11  13  17  20  13  9   15
# Pearson's Correlation Coefficient

# Where: -  is Pearson's correlation coefficient,
# -  and  are the individual sample points,
# -  and  are the means of the  and  values,
# -  is the number of data points.

# Output Format

# Print the correlation coefficient as a floating-point value rounded to three decimal places, without leading or trailing spaces.

# For example, if your answer is 0.255. In python you can print using

# print("0.255")
# This is NOT the actual answer - just the format in which you should provide your answer.

# If you would like to test code that calculates the value, choose 'Test agains custom input' and enter anything into the input box, e.g., 'x'. The code will not run without some value in the input box. When you are satisfied with the output, press 'Submit Code'.

# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT
